Test Driven Extensions

Current Sensing at high fidelity

 - The current sensor has a 12-bit A2D converter.
 - The sensor is capable of sensing a maximum temperature of 10 Amps.
 - A reading of 0 means 0A and a reading of 4094 means 10 Amps.
 - The readings in-between are linearly scaled.
 - A reading of 4095 indicates an error.

 - Your program needs to be compatible with 12-bit input. 
   Assume that the 12-bit numbers are transmitted as an array of integers 
   (no bit-level packing).

responsibility of the extension

Test driven development

- Ignore the error readings
- convert 12 bit input into Amps, and round off the result to nearest integers

Test driven Integration

 write a function to convert any bit of numbers to its corresponding value
 write a function to take min value and max value of the binary convertor
 write a function to ignore the error readings
 write a function to convert absolute values
 write a function to remove negative values, as we need the magnitude of the data
     negative and positive only implecates the charging and discharging

Step 1 : Write KPI and Test, make the test Fail
Step 2 : Write Simplest Code to make the test pass
Step 3 : Add more test, and modify the Code
Step 4 : Additional Refactoring

KPI : 
take n bit data as input bit array, and convert the n bit array data into value

Test Case Design (Data Driven development)
{
    "Input Array" : [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0],
    "nth_bit_value" : 12,
    "Min Amps" : 0,
    "Max Amps" : 10,
    "Result" : 7
} 

Process Of Creating the Section

Step 1 : Creating a new json file with sample test result
Step 2 : Adding a test function to check the result output, 
         make the test fail
Step 3 : Create simplest code to make the test pass
